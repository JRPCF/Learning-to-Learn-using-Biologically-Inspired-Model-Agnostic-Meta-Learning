# Learning-to-Learn-using-Model-Agnostic-Meta-Learning-with-Non-Episodic-Memory

This is a project that plans on discovering how a Meta-RL architecture with non-episodic memory might perform on learning to learn and transferring knowledge to adjacent tasks. The project is mostly focused on merging Recurrent Geometric Neural Nets and Model-Agnostic MetaLearning and observing how agents perform on Open-AI Gym Atari Games.
